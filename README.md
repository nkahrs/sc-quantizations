# sc-quantizations
SuperCollider code used for some of my "Quantizations" series of pieces for instruments and electronics

In `q1`, _Quantizations 1_ was supposed to be for solo live electronic, namely two microphone-speaker feedback systems ring-modulating each other. This never happened, but electronics were later repurposed.

_Quantziations 2_ was for orchestra, without electronics. Pitch material was largely generated with my Haskell combination tone library, especially [https://github.com/nkahrs/difference-tones/blob/master/1127fm.hs].

In `q3`, _Quantizations 3_ is for clarinet and live electronics.

_Quantizations 4_ involved playback of samples. Most samples ended up being created very tediously in Max/MSP.

In `q5`,_Quantizations 5_ for two sixxen and live electronics is in progress, but the tools I'm using (though no sound files) are here.

`cmp-412` contains short pieces written for Bob Morris' "Compositional Practices 1925-1955" course, which are fully electronic but all explore similar concerns to the _Quantizations_ pieces.
